# Railway Configuration for DataSphere
#
# IMPORTANT: Database Persistence Setup
# To persist data across deploys, you MUST create a Railway Volume:
# 1. Go to your Railway project dashboard
# 2. Click on the service -> Settings -> Volumes
# 3. Add a new volume with mount path: /data
# 4. Redeploy the service
#
# The database will be stored at /data/adhd.db
